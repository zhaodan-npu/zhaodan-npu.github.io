I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), specializing in stochastic dynamics and nonlinear systems. My research focuses on pioneering novel strategies for the prediction and control of extreme events in critical infrastructures.

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the joint supervision of Prof. JÃ¼rgen Kurths and Prof. Yong Xu. My potential has been recognized internationally through the prestigious Sino-German (CSC-DAAD) Postdoc Scholarship.
